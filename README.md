## Course Summary

Responder is a powerful API creation tool with the simplicity and power similar to its sibling Requests. It aims to bring 'flask-like route creation' and Falcon like mutability.

Most notably, is its ease of setup for both synchronous and ASYNCHRONOUS web APIs. So it won't just be lightweight, IT WILL BE BLAZING FAST!

## What's this course about and how is it different?

In this mini course, we will cover the key concepts of required to build an API using Responder.

This is not a comprehensive course, but rather an introduction to this new and powerful framework. You will learn to get up to speed quickly by building a clone of the API over at [movie_service.talkpython.fm](http://movie_service.talkpython.fm/) in Responder in just 48 minutes. 

## What we will build in this course

In this course, you will build a simple API that we will use to make requests for in our very own web application.

We are going to build an async-capable API that will be able to display information via:

- Template Based Views
- JSON based endpoints

We will also see how to access the API using Vue.js and Axios.js and test it with Postman.

## Who is this course for?

Anyone who would like to write Python code to build API-based websites.

This is not a beginner course. You will need a basic understanding of Python and HTML/CSS. You will also need to understand the basics of REST APIs.

## Get hands-on this this course

Learning to code is an interactive experience. That's why it's important to write async code and explore the apps we build during this course. Most chapters have code samples stored in the GitHub repo saved at various stages throughout the chapter. This means you can grab whichever one you want and start trying the code for yourself.

There is also an independent self-directed project to build on your knowledge at the end of the course.
